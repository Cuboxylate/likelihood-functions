# This script needs:
#   - BiSSELikelihood.R and birthDeathLikelihood.R loaded
#   - the working directory set to the folder containing this script
# 
# This'll work best if you run it after compareWithExistingFunctions.R

# Sample Data:
# - Data on primate species and their activity periods - diurnal or nocturnal
# - Magnuson-Ford K., Otto S.P. 2012. Linking the Investigations of Character 
#   Evolution and Species Diversification. The American Naturalist. 180:225â€“245. 10.1086/666649
# - Accessed from https://revbayes.github.io/tutorials/sse/bisse.html

# NB: I didn't use this dataset for the compareWithExistingFunctions script because
# the numbers get very small and the diversitree function wasn't handling it well
